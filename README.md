# Introduction to Electronics

Hello!

This is a small practical course in Electronics, following these theoretical lessons:

In order to be able to run the experiments you need:
1. Any computer (Windows, Linux or Mac), **better if it is a laptop** (because it can run on batteries):

2. An **Arduino UNO** board (or others compatible boards) + a breadboard + some basic electronic components. I have this kit:

3. The **Arduino IDE** software platform: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

4. The **Processing** software platform (use last **STABLE** version): https://processing.org/

5. The **Kicad** EDA software suite: https://www.kicad.org/

For the **Bioamplifier** experiment you also need:
1. some (at least 3) skin patch electrodes (e.g. https://www.biopac.com/product/general-purpose-electrodes/)

2. Three alligator clamps, for the connection to the electrodes:

3. one glorious :) TL084 operational amplifier:

I have also modified the trimmers I use in these experiments, by soldering them on a small PCB like this one:

...it's not strictly necessary but it helps a lot, otherwise it might be difficult to insert it on the breadboard!
